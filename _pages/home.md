**Welcome!!**

I am an Evolutionary Ecologist at the University of Glasgow. My research focusses on the study of animal responses to human-induced environmental change using correlative and experimental approaches in the field and lab. I strive to connect fundamental evolutionary/ecological research and applied research, seeking opportunities where my research can be translated to inform human public health, biodiversity conservation or wild animal welfare.
