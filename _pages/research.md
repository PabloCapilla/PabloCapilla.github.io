My research aims to improve our understanding of how human-induced environmental change affects animal ecology and evolution. The main focus of my research is often on ecological causes and evolutionary consequences of **behavioural responses in anthropogenic environments**. However, I take an **integrative approach** including the understanding of the proximate mechanisms (e.g., physiological processes) and the consequences (e.g., for evolution, animal welfare or human health) of human-induced changes in aninmal behaviour.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher, working with [Davide Dominoni](https://www.davidedominoni.com/), at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/bohvm/staff/pablocapillalasheras/), studying (i) **circadian patterns of behavioural and physiological activity** in urban and non-urban passerine birds; and, (ii) anthropogenic effects on the **gut microbiomes** of wild birds and their consequences for adaptation to these environments and for animal welfare. I have recently launched the **Scops Owl project**, in collaboration with Prof Barbara Helm at the Swiss Institute of Ornithology, to investigate how human activity on the planet (in particular light pollution) affects long-distance migration and gut microbiome dynamics of Eurasian scops owls (_Otus scops_).

Before starting my current postdoctoral position in Glasgow, I was extremely lucky to be a PhD student at the incredible [white-browed sparrow weaver project](http://www.animalsocieties.org/sparrowweaverproject).
