During my PhD research, I investigated the benefits and costs of cooperation in unpredictable  environments, integrating long-term ecological, behavioural and life history datasets, animal tracking and genomics using the [incredible white-browed sparrow weavers](http://www.animalsocieties.org/sparrowweaverproject).

Then, I am applying this background to contribute towards increasing our understanding of animal responses to  human-induced environmental change. Environmental conditions on Earth are drastically changing as a direct result of human activity on the planet. From a fundamental evolutionary perspective, human-induced environmental change is extremely interesting as it creates new opportunities for life to adapt to and where the mechanism of evolution can be studied in real time. I strive to connect fundamental evolutionary research and applied research, seeking opportunities where my research can be translated to biodiversity conservation, wild animal welfare or informed human public health. In this context, I have started two research lines: one studying the causes and consequences of variation in bird gut microbiomes in urban environments, and a second one assessing how anthropogenic factors affect long-distance migration.
