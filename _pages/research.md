My research tries to improve the understanding of how human-induced environmental change affects animal ecology and evolution. I combine the study of behavioural traits (e.g., circadian rhythms, migration, and cooperation) and physiological traits (e.g., host-associated microbiome dynamics) to gain insights on fundamental evolutionary ecology and applied biodiversity conservation, wild animal welfare and human health.

I was a PhD student at the incredible [white-browed sparrow weaver project](http://www.animalsocieties.org/sparrowweaverproject), before starting a postdoctoral position at the University of Glasgow to investigate how urbanisation affects daily patterns of activity and physiology. I have recently launched the Scops Owl project, in collaboration with Prof Barbara Helm at the Swiss Institute of Ornithology, to investigate how human activity on the planet affects long-distance migration and host-associated microbiome dynamics.
