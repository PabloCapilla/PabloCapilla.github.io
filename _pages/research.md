<h2 style="text-align: center;">RESEARCH</h2>
My research aims to improve our understanding of how human-induced environmental change affects animal ecology and evolution. My main focus is often on ecological causes and evolutionary consequences of **behavioural responses in anthropogenic environments**. However, I take an **integrative approach** including the understanding of the proximate mechanisms (e.g., physiological processes) and the consequences (e.g., for evolution, animal welfare or human health) of human-induced changes in animal behaviour. I am currently a Global Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action Fellow working with Barbara Helm at the [Swiss Ornithological Institute (Vogelwarte)](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/) and Carles Vilà at the [Doñana Biological Station-CSIC](http://www.ebd.csic.es/en/inicio).

During my fellowship, I am investigating human-induced changes in long-distance bird migration and their evolutionary consequences. If you are interested in how urbanisation, human-induced environmental change or artificial light at night affect long-distance animal migration, you can find out more about [**MIGRALIGHT** on its webpage](https://pablocapilla.github.io/MIGRALIGHT/) and on [social media](https://www.instagram.com/migralight/).

Additionally, I keep an active collaboration with [Davide Dominoni](https://www.davidedominoni.com/), at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), where we study (i) **circadian patterns of behavioural and physiological activity** in urban and non-urban passerine birds; and, (ii) **anthropogenic effects on the gut microbiomes** of wild birds and their consequences for adaptation to these environments and for animal welfare. I started my academic career at the University of Exeter, working with [Andy Young](http://www.animalsocieties.org) as a PhD student at the incredible [white-browed sparrow weaver project](http://www.animalsocieties.org/sparrowweaverproject).
