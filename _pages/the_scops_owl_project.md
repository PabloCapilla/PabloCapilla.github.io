## Overview
The Scops Owl Project aims to understand how human-induced environmental changes affect long-distance animal migration and the evolutionary consequences of these migratory changes. For these, we are monitoring the migration of multiple populations of scops owl (_Otus scops_) living in contrasting environments across a very wide geographical range. The project has been launched with support from the Swiss Ornithological Institute (Vogelwarte) and its extensive in-house experience in bird tracking.

## The study species
The Scops Owl is one of the smallest owl species and the only long-distance migratory owl in Europe. It breeds around the Mediterranean sea and winters in Sub-saharan Africa. Although vulnerable to endangered across its distribution range, it is often abundant and it commonly uses urban habitats to breed. Additionally, it readily uses nest-boxes to breed, which in combination with its abundance in human-altered habitats, makes this species an ideal candidate to investigate (i) how migratory behaviours change in anthropogenic habitats and (ii) the evolutionary, ecological and animal welfare consequences of such changes.

## Impact

This project represents a multi-country collaboration, involving public and scientific organisations in Europe. As well as offering new insights into how animals respond to anthropogenic habitat change, the use of a
