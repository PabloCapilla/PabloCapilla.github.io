**Welcome to Pablo Capilla-Lasheras’ research website**

I am an Evolutionary Ecologist at the University of Glasgow. My research focusses on the study of animal responses to human-induced environmental change. I ask both evolutionary and mechanistic questions, using correlative and experimental approaches in the field and lab.

Environmental conditions on Earth are drastically changing as a direct result of human activity on the planet. From a fundamental evolutionary perspective, human-induced environmental change is extremely interesting as it creates new opportunities for life to adapt to and where the mechanisms of evolution by natural selection can be studied in real time. I strive to connect fundamental evolutionary/ecological research and applied research, seeking opportunities where my research can be translated to inform human public health, biodiversity conservation or wild animal welfare.

You can find out more about my main research projects and publications using the tabs above. Enjoy!

If you’re keen to collaborate just drop me an email.
